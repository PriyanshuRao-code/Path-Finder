# Path-Finder
A program that uses recursion to solve a maze represented as a 2D matrix.
The matrix contains cells representing open paths ('0'), obstacles ('1'), the start ('S'), and the destination ('D'). 
The goal is to find a path from the start to the destination.
The program should print if path is found or not.

The program takes care of 'S' or 's' and 'D' or 'd'
